          <p>I am currently a student in the Computer Programming and Analysis program at Seneca College, where my deep passion for technology and programming continues to shape my academic journey. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work in various industries, which has allowed me to develop a diverse skill set. However, I have decided to focus my career on becoming an expert in programming. Throughout my journey, I have embraced key values such as leadership, teamwork, integrity, and honesty, all of which have positively influenced my professional path. Independence has been a cornerstone of my life since childhood, and I take pride in being self-sufficient and driven. I am committed to my education and confident in the bright future that lies ahead in the tech industry.</p>
